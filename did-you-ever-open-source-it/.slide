* What comes to your mind when you think about open source?

* What I thought it was before starting doing...
- Working for free
- Tasks that nobody wants to do
- Crazy projects
- Bug fixes
- Adding Tests
- I'm not sure I can help
- Only BIG projects are open source

* Then I realized it is just FUN!

* I have an invitation for you!

* What if I tell you, that you can start having FUN right now?
* What if I tell you, that there is GAME, that's Open Source and made with Go?

* This is a game that I started few days ago, Flappy Gopher!

* This an open source game, made with Go!

* It helped me a lot learning how to Go and can also help you!

* But, just to give you an idea how this project evolved over the time

* We started this way, this was the first version ever.

* Then with some motivation and a lot of FUN we got this.

* After that we got clouds and better color!

* Up in the sky, look: It's a bird. It's a plane. It's SuperGopher!

* Holy s**t, now we have textures for the trunks with dynamic sizes!

* And you may ask, BUT HOW CAN I HELP WITH THIS PROJECT??

* This game still need:
- Collision - [[https://github.com/tclemos/flappy-gopher/issues/1]]
- Game Score - [[https://github.com/tclemos/flappy-gopher/issues/2]]
- Scoreboard - [[https://github.com/tclemos/flappy-gopher/issues/3]]

* Or maybe we can get things a little bit wild
- A player sprite with animations(moving cape, acrobatics)
- Other elements flying around(birds, planes)
- Daylight changes, day, night, afternoon, sunset, sunrise
- A moving trunk after the first 10
- A tighter trunk
- A random item that can be collected and works like Mario star
- A random item that add extra points
- Life system (chances) to continue
- Ability to continue by exchanging part of the current score by a new chance
- Sound effects
- Background music

* Also, maybe you'll find a better way to do something that is already implemented
* The point is, enjoy open source and have FUN!
