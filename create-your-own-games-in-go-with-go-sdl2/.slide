* Today we are going to learn how to create something like this in Go with go-sdl2

* Ok, but what is go-sdl2?

* What motivated me to develop a game and why did I choose Go for that?

* Basically it as a sequence of factors
- I love playing games
- I always wanted to create a game and I already did something in the past.
- It's way easier to explain what I do to my kids with a game instead of an API.
- It is easier to study when it is funny
- I'm currently studying and working with Go, making a game was a good excuse to convince me to learn more about it.

* Why did I choose flappy bird as a theme for my game?

* A game structure in go looks basically this

.code code/basic-game-structure.go

* Initializing
.code code/init-game.go 

* Some SDL2 functions

* Listen to events
.code code/sdl2-funcs.go /^func \(g \*Game\) checkPollEvents\(\) {/,/^}/

* Keyboard state
.code code/sdl2-funcs.go /^func \(g \*Game\) checkKeys\(\) {/,/^}/

* Rendering something to the screen
.code code/sdl2-funcs.go /^func \(g \*Game\) drawBackGround\(\) {/,/^}/
.code code/sdl2-funcs.go /^func \(g \*Game\) drawTexture\(\) {/,/^}/

* Things I've learned during this journey so far
- Go routines
- Math
- Design
- UX
- Components
- Choices between a Copy or a Pointer

* Developing a game in Go brought to my life things like:
- I'm becoming a better professional.
- I'm understanding better the Go language.
- I'm motivated with the things that I know about and do on a daily basis.
- I'm closer to my kids and now they are interested about what I do and are proud of it.
- I've got noticed by the community and I'm participating.
- I had a good time doing this, it is like a terapy.

* Get motivated!
- Start doing something that is funny
