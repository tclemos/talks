# talks

Here you'll find slides from talks I have done.

Talks are organized by topic.

These talks were created using `markdown` to be presented with `go present` tool.

To watch the presentations, make sure to have `git`, `go` and `go present tool` installed. You can use the following commands to install it.

```bash
brew install git
brew install go
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/present
```

Now clone this repo and then run the `present` command in the root directory.

```bash
present 
```

this command logs a line that tell you which url should be accessed in the browser to watch the presentations, the default URL is `http://127.0.0.1:3999`
