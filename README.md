Welcome to my `Talks` repository.

Here you'll find all the slides from talks I have done.

As you can see, talkes are not organized by event/date, they are organized by topic and can be updated. 

Make sure to clone, download or fork this repo if you want a presentation to remains the same.

These talks were created using `mardown` for `.slides` files and were meant to be presented using `go present` tool.

To watch the presentations in this repository, make sure to have `git`, `go` and `go present tool` installed. You can use the following commands to install it.

```
$ brew install git
$ brew install go
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/present
```

After having everyting installed, you can clone this repo and then run the `present` command in the root directory.

```
$ present 
```

this command log a line that tella you which url should be accessed in the browser to watch the presentations, generally it is the `http://127.0.0.1:3999`
